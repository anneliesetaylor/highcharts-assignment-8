    <h1>Gender Inequality in the Workforce</h1>

  <p>Defined as the difference between the median earnings of men and women relative to the median earnings of men, the gender wage gap is a pervasive global issue. The <a href="https://www.pay-equity.org/day.html" target="_blank">National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE)</a> began the Equal Pay Day initiative in 1996 to shed light on the severity of the gap between men’s and women’s wages in America. <a href="https://www.pay-equity.org/day.html" target="_blank">The initiative</a> attempts to make the disadvantage that women are put at financially more apparent through calculating how far into the year a woman must work in order to earn what the average man earns in the previous year. The importance of symbolic days like Equal Pay Day and other gender inequality reduction initiatives lies within the fact that the gender wage gap costs the average American woman anywhere from $700,000 to $2 million over a working lifetime, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/03/equal-pay-day-is-march-31-earliest-since-1996.html" target="_blank">as calculated by the NCPE</a>. At this current rate, it will take until 2059 for women to achieve equal pay.</p>

  <p>But, despite the fact that women have made large strides in attempting to eradicate this financial disparity, the women’s-to-men’s earnings ratio has remained in the 80 to 83 percent range since 2004, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2019/women-had-higher-median-earnings-than-men-in-relatively-few-occupations-in-2018.htm" target="_blank">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Within the first quarter of 2020, The median weekly earnings for women were $857, or <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2020/women-had-median-weekly-earnings-of-857-or-80-point-4-percent-of-mens-earnings-first-quarter-2020.htm" target="_blank">80.4 percent of the median</a> of $1,066 for men.</p>

  <p>However, though the United States is one of the more significantly afflicted countries, this is not just an issue that plagues America. The gender wage gap affects countries globally, causing large discrepancies in the earnings of men versus those of women.</p>

<article id="explanation3">
  <p>The global gender wage gap stems from a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender" target="_blank">plethora of issues</a>, some of which include women being underrepresented in senior positions in firms, the tendency of men to possess more control over productive assets than women, and overrepresentation of women in low-paying jobs. And, as a result of factors like these and others, no country has yet to eliminate gender inequality in the workplace and <a href="https://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2020/the-global-gender-gap-index-2020/box-1/" target="_blank">achieve gender parity in wages</a>. It is important to continue monitoring the difference in women’s versus men’s financial compensation in the workforce in order to determine if progress is being made to lessen the gap and measure the impact of initiatives like Equal Pay Day.</p>
